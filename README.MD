Purpose: Pings all of the servers in a specified column in a `.xlsx` file. I used it in a production scenario
to check if 500+ servers were online/responsive. 

Warnings: 

Not super flexible. Not tested on many datasets. (Crash-prevention might fail on different datasets).

This should be using my ExcelColumnHeaders project as an import but is not currently.
