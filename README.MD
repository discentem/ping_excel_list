`Purpose:` Pings all of the servers in a specified column in a `.xlsx` file. I used it in a production scenario
to check if 500+ servers were online/responsive. 

`Warnings:` I haven't tested this on many datasets, so I might have missed certain cases for cell data (which could lead to crashes).
	    This should be using my ExcelColumnHeaders project as an import but is not currently.
